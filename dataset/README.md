# FormulationBench

A dataset of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, multiple natural-language and code formulations of each problem, and machine-checked Lean 4 proofs of MILP reformulations.

Each problem is presented in several alternative formulations that may differ in variable naming, parameter naming, the algebraic form of the constraints, the choice of decision variables, or the objective expression. Some pairs of formulations describe the same optimization problem (a "reformulation"); others differ in a way that changes the feasible set or the optimal value (not a reformulation). The Lean 4 files in `reformulations/` formalize each reformulation pair.

## Problem-Level Files

For each problem `pN`:

- **`description.md`** — A self-contained natural-language description of the optimization problem.
- **`problem.json`** — Schema of the parameters: each parameter has a human description and a `shape` (`[]` for a scalar, `["nA", "nT"]` for a 2D array indexed by named dimensions). Includes `metadata.source` indicating which `sources/` subset the problem was adapted from.
- **`data.json`** — A concrete instance: parameter values used to test that all valid formulations produce the same optimum.
- **`solution.json`** — A reference optimal solution and objective value for the instance in `data.json`.

## Formulation-Level Files

For each formulation `pN/formulations/x/`:

- **`formulation.json`** — Structured description of the MILP:
  - `valid` — boolean indicating whether the formulation is a valid formulation for the parent problem.
  - `parameters` — parameters for the MILP formulation; should be a function of problem parameters provided in `data.json`. Each parameter has `{description, shape}`. Shapes use the same notation as variable shapes (see below).
  - `assumptions` — list of parameter assumptions, each with `{description, formulation (LaTeX), explicit (bool), code.python}`. The `explicit` flag is `true` when the assumption is stated explicitly in the original problem text; `false` when it is implicit (e.g., non-negativity of a rate that is obviously physical). Assumptions on parameters are distinct from constraints on decision variables.
  - `definitions` — *(optional)* ordered dict of named derived quantities computed from parameters before variables are declared, each with `{description, code.python}`. Typical uses: big-M constants, pre-computed index sets, and other values referenced in variable or constraint code. Definitions are emitted into `solve.py` in declaration order.
  - `variables` — dict of decision variables, each with `{description, type, shape}` and optionally `indices`. `type` is one of `"integer"`, `"continuous"`, or `"binary"`. The `shape` field and `indices` field are mutually exclusive ways of specifying the variable's index structure (see below).
  - `constraints` — list of `{description, formulation (LaTeX), explicit (bool), code.gurobipy}`. The `explicit` flag is `true` when the constraint appears explicitly in the problem statement; `false` for implied constraints such as non-negativity bounds.
  - `objective` — `{description, formulation (LaTeX), code.gurobipy}`.
  - `imports` — *(optional)* list of additional Python import statements to include in the generated `solve.py` (e.g., `["import math"]`). These are emitted after the standard gurobipy imports.

### Variable Shape Notation

The `shape` field of a variable (and of parameters) encodes the index dimensions as a list of strings or integers:

- **Scalar** — `[]` (empty list): the variable is a single scalar.
- **Fixed dimension** — a string naming a scalar parameter (e.g., `"n"`, `"T"`): the dimension ranges over `range(param)`.
- **Expression dimension** — a string containing an arithmetic expression over scalar parameters (e.g., `"K+N"`): used as-is in generated code.
- **Ragged dimension** — a string of the form `"X[Y]"` where `X` is a parameter array and `Y` is another dimension name already in the shape: the size of this dimension depends on the value of `X` at the outer index `Y`. For example, `["n_G", "n_S[n_G]"]` means for each generator `g in range(n_G)`, the second dimension ranges over `range(n_S[g])`. Ragged variables are represented as dicts in generated code.
- **Cardinality notation** — a string of the form `"|X|"` where `X` is a definition or set: used in the mathematical `formulation` field to denote the cardinality of set `X`. When `|X|` appears in `shape`, an `indices` expression must be provided.

The `indices` field is an alternative to `shape` for variables indexed by an explicit, possibly irregular set. It contains a Python expression (a generator or comprehension) that produces the keys used to call `model.addVars(...)`. When `indices` is present, `shape` still appears (typically with `|X|` notation) to document the conceptual size in the mathematical formulation, but `indices` is what drives code generation.

- **`gen_params.py`** — Generates `parameters.json` (a map of `parameters`) from the shared `data.json` (with stores problem-level `parameters`).
- **`solve.py`** — A Gurobi script that loads `parameters.json` and writes `solution.json`. A formulation and its reformulations produce the same objective on the same instance. Note this scripts is deterministically generated from the code defined in the `formulation.json`.
- **`Formulation.lean`** — A Lean 4 encoding of the MILP as a `MILPFormulation` (defined in `Common.lean`).

## Reformulation Pairs and Proofs

`pairs.json` is a flat list of formulation pairs:

```json
{
  "a": {"problem": 1, "formulation": "a"},
  "b": {"problem": 1, "formulation": "b"},
  "reformulation": true
}
```

For each reformulation pair there is a corresponding Lean file `reformulations/pN/a_b.lean` constructing a `MILPReformulation` instance (defined in `Common.lean`). Pairs that are not reformulations of one another have no Lean file by design: the dataset records them as labelled negative examples.
