"""Codegen + end-to-end solve tests for a representative set of formulations.

``Formulation.gen_solve_py`` (backed by :mod:`formulation_bench._codegen`) only
has a single doctest covering p12, which uses one narrow shape of formulation.
The four problems below collectively exercise every branch of the codegen that
is reachable from real dataset formulations:

* **p8**  — indexed and scalar variables, ``definitions``, ``Model``-style imports
* **p9**  — extra ``imports``, ``gp``-style imports, 1-D arrays, implicit constraints
* **p11** — ragged variables (drives ``_codegen._build_loops``)
* **p20** — 3-D+ arrays

Each formulation is code-generated, compiled, run end to end
(``gen_params`` -> generated ``solve.py``), and -- when the formulation is
valid -- checked against the objective recorded in the dataset.

The only ``_codegen`` lines not reached this way are the index-letter collision
fallback in ``_build_loops``, which no real formulation triggers; see
``test_build_loops_index_collision`` for a direct unit test of that path.
